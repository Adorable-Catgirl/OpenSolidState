# OpenSolidState
An extension to OpenComputers that adds (E)EPROM cards, and maybe more things down the line!

## A note about SSDs
No. I will not add SSDs that will replace HDDs. Just putting that out there now.

## Requirements
* [Shadowfacts' Forgelin](https://github.com/shadowfacts/Forgelin/)
* [OpenComputers](https://github.com/MightyPirates/OpenComputers/tree/master-MC1.12)

## Ideas for the future
* Compute Cards
* Small R/W flash memory
* Vector screens?
