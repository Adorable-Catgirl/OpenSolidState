## Code
* Feel free to recommend stuff in Java, but just know I'll probably convert it to Kotlin.
* Java should go in `src/main/java`.
* Use tabs in Kotlin and Java.
* Use two spaces in Lua.
* I do not like Scala.
* At all.
* Do not try to add Scala.
* Don't add anything out of scope for the mod
	* This mod will contain useful additions to OpenComputers that aren't too out of character
	* Yeah, it's not strictly solid-state stuff, but don't go overboard
* Don't add things already in Computronics or OpenComputers.

## Art
* I have no clue
	* I need to ask someone about what to put here
